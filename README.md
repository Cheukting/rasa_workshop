Rasa will create a list of files for you, but we mostly care about the following:

* `actions.py` : code for your custom actions
* `config.yml` : configuration of your NLU and Core models
* `data/nlu.md` :your NLU training data
* `data/stories.md` : your stories
* `domain.yml` : your assistantâ€™s domain
