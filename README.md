# Step Into the AI Era: Chatbots that know if you are angry

In this workshop, we will try to build a chatbot that will ask for the user's contact details (compile to GDPR) and feedback of an event that they may have attended.


## Install Rasa and set up the environment

Clone this repo form Github:

`git clone (insert link) .`

Enter the directory:

`cd rasa_workshop`

(optional) Create a new [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) environment

Install the requirements:

`pip install -r requirement.txt`

## Create a new project

Creat a new directory (you could replace `my_chatbot` to any name you like):

`mkdir my_chatbot`

Go to the directory:

`cd my_chatbot`

Initiate a project:

`rasa init --no-prompt`

Rasa will create a list of files for you, but we mostly care about the following:

* `actions.py` : code for your custom actions
* `config.yml` : configuration of your NLU and Core models
* `data/nlu.md` : your NLU training data
* `data/stories.md` : your stories
* `domain.yml` : your assistantâ€™s domain

We will explain what they are and how to set them up in this workshop.

## Pipeline and NLU setup

Now we will need to train the NLU, which is a natural language processing tool for intent classification and entity extraction.

For the entity, since we will be using the pretrained Spacy embedding pipeline !!! the entity will be captured by Spacy. Thus in `data/nlu.md` we only need to provide the intent examples.

Open `data/nlu.md` with text editor or IDE of your choice.

We see in the default example that some examples for different intents are set up. In our use case, since we will be doing sentiment analysis using NLTK, we can delete the sections for `mood_great` and `mood_sad`. Feel free to add more example for the other intents, the more example the better is the understanding of the chatbot.

After that, we have to setup the [NLP pipeline](http://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/choosing-a-pipeline/), it can be done by editing `config.yml`. Here we will change the `supervised_embeddings` to `pretrained_embeddings_spacy` so we will be using pretrained Spacy embedding pipeline instead.
